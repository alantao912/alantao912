### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,
My name is Alan Tao (he/him/his). I'm a undergraduate computer science student at Georgia Tech. I'm currently working on "juliette", a computer chess application ðŸ”¬ðŸ§ . I am interested in learning more about tree-search algorithms, bitwise board representations, and effective positional evaluation heuristics. I am open to collaboration on this project :). Otherwise, I also enjoy solving algorithms problems, playing chess, and making games. I can be reached at alantao912@protonmail.ch. Ask me about my status ðŸ˜ˆ

Fun Fact: Jet fuel can't melt steel beams.
